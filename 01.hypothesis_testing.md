# 1. Hypothesis testing with t-test

To perform a hypothesis test for two samples with continuous features, you can use a two-sample t-test. A two-sample t-test is a statistical test that determines if there is a significant difference between the means of two independent groups. The test assumes that the samples are drawn from normal distributions and that the variances of the two groups are equal.

Here is the null and alternative hypothesis for a two-sample t-test:

H0 (null hypothesis): The means of the two samples are equal.
Ha (alternative hypothesis): The means of the two samples are not equal.

To perform the test, you'll need to calculate the means and standard deviations of the two groups and use those values to compute the t-statistic. The t-statistic is used to determine the probability that the difference between the means is due to chance. If this probability is below a predetermined significance level (e.g., 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.

It's important to note that the choice of significance level and the normality assumption can affect the results of the test, so it's important to carefully consider the appropriate level for your situation and to check the assumptions using statistical techniques such as a Q-Q plot or a Shapiro-Wilk test.

# 2. How to check normality
```
# Load required library
library(ggplot2)

# Generate sample data
set.seed(123)
sample1 <- rnorm(100, mean = 10, sd = 2)
sample2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 11, sd = 2)

# Check normality using histogram and Q-Q plot
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(sample1, main = "Histogram of Sample 1", col = "blue")
hist(sample2, main = "Histogram of Sample 2", col = "red")
qqnorm(sample1, main = "Q-Q Plot of Sample 1", col = "blue")
qqline(sample1)
qqnorm(sample2, main = "Q-Q Plot of Sample 2", col = "red")
qqline(sample2)

# Perform Shapiro-Wilk test to formally check normality
shapiro1 <- shapiro.test(sample1)
shapiro2 <- shapiro.test(sample2)

# Check normality assumption and perform appropriate test
if (shapiro1$p.value > 0.05 & shapiro2$p.value > 0.05) {
  # Perform two-sample t-test if normality assumption is met
  result <- t.test(sample1, sample2, var.equal = TRUE)
  cat("Two-sample t-test is performed as the normality assumption is met\n")
} else {
  # Perform Wilcoxon signed-rank test if normality assumption is not met
  result <- wilcox.test(sample1, sample2)
  cat("Wilcoxon signed-rank test is performed as the normality assumption is not met\n")
}

# Print test results
print(result)
```
